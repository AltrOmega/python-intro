######### Functions
### zip
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip
Returns a transposition of given lists, allowing for iteration over more than one list at once.

### enumerate
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate
Returns a given list as a list of tuples with a number at [i][0] and the original value at [i][1],
thus allowing easy iteration with numbers and the original object at the same time.
Basically, kind of like zipping the original list and a range of its length.

### sorted
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted
Returns a new sorted list based on the one given as an argument.



######### Modules
### math
https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#module-math
As the name says, has some useful math utilities.

### random
https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#module-random
As the name says, has some randomization utilities.

### time
https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#module-time
As the name says, has some time utilities.



######### Exceptions
### ValueError
https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError
"Raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the right
type but an inappropriate value, and the situation is not described by a more
precise exception such as IndexError."
Aka, if you expect only a subset of all possible values of a given type and the function gets one of the ones
you don't expect, you throw this.

### ZeroDivisionError
https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError
As the name says, is thrown when you try to divide by 0.
