# Introducing Chaos and Entropy to Your Codebase!

Have you ever felt like your code is way too predictable and/or too clean?  
Oh golly, do I have a solution for you!

For the low price of **$0.00**, you can make use of my awesome Python library that brings chaos and entropy to your codebase!

## Features

### **RandomThrow** (from `error_tools`)
RandomThrow will throw you a memory error with a given chance.  
Because who doesn't love a little unpredictability in their error handling?

---

### **math_tools**
#### **bitEntropy**
- Flips some of the last 3 rightmost bits... sometimes.  
- It brings to Python that classic floating-point number rot, but with integers this time!

#### **genericFloatBehaviour**
- Makes floating-point numbers behave like *actual* floating-point numbers in Python!  
- Never again will you have to wonder if \( 1.4 + 2.2 \) is \( 3.6000000002 \) in Pythonâ€”because it could always be, if you so wished!

---

### **text_processing**
#### **chaos**
- Swaps some letters in your strings... sometimes.

#### **gibberish**
- Repeats letters in your strings, creating pure gibberish.

Yes, it's as bad as the name suggests. You can garble any string from the comfort of your own Python script!

---

### **print_utils**
Do you think the default `print` statement is too sane?  
Well, `print_utils` has you covered!

- Apply the effects of **chaos** and **gibberish** to all of your print statements.  
- Just grab the function pointer and override the old, generic, and boring `print`.  
- Easy as pie!

#### **gibberishChaosPrint**
If you feel especially daring, you can use `gibberishChaosPrint`, which applies **both chaos and gibberish** at the same time!

## Why Choose Chaos?

Because clean code is overrated, and sometimes you just need a little entropy in your life.  
So go ahead, embrace the chaos, and make your codebase a little less predictable today!
